This repo is a collection of assignments and hands-on tasks from my NLP (Natural Language Processing) course. Each notebook dives into a different concept or project using popular NLP tools and techniques.

### What’s Inside

**`skipgram_cbow.ipynb`**
This notebook shows how skip-gram and CBOW (Continuous Bag-of-Words) models work using Gensim.
You'll find:

* How to load pre-trained word vectors like GloVe
* Fun stuff like finding similar words and averaging embeddings

**`ner_with_spacy.ipynb`**
Here, I play around with Named Entity Recognition (NER) using SpaCy.
It covers:

* Loading and formatting datasets (like CoNLL 2003)
* Setting things up so SpaCy can train on them
* Getting a basic NER pipeline running

**`Pytorch_training_and_testing.ipynb`**
This one’s all about building a simple model from scratch in PyTorch.
What it includes:

* Creating a training loop
* Making a small 1D regression dataset
* Training a basic multi-layer neural network with PyTorch tools like `torch.nn` and `DataLoader`

### Ongoing Work

I’ll keep adding more as the course moves forward. The goal is to experiment with different NLP ideas, models, and libraries along the way.
